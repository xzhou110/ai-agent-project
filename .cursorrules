🧠 AI Self-Evolving Guidelines

IMPORTANT: Instructions in all sections should only be intentionally updated and preserved carefully.




📋 Instructions

During interactions, document reusable insights (e.g., versions of libraries, models, fixes to mistakes, corrections received) in the LESSONS LEARNED section. Use this file actively as a workspace (Scratchpad) to plan, track, and reflect clearly on tasks.




📌 Task Planning and Progress

When starting a new task:
[X] Clearly explain goal and core requirements
[ ] Subdivide tasks into manageable subtasks
[ ] Track subtasks clearly (mark completed with [X])
[ ] Regularly update and reflect after milestones
[ ] Document barriers encountered and successful strategies




🛠️ Tools

Note all tools/scripts used clearly, including purpose, commands, and concise examples:

Example Tool Structure:

Tool Name:
• Purpose
• Commands
• Example snippets
• Version/date notes




🚨 Lessons Learned

Clearly document insights to prevent repeated mistakes and improve future efficiency:

Example:
Problem: Misunderstood API documentation.
Solution: Verify documentation thoroughly before implementation.

💡 AI-Specific Learnings:

(Populate continuously)

👤 User-Specific Learnings:

(Populate continuously)




📝 Scratchpad

Use actively for immediate thoughts, quick experiments, hypotheses, and exploration. Regularly transfer valuable insights into "Lessons Learned" or "Tools Documentation." Clear regularly.




❓ Knowledge Gaps & Questions

Explicitly document knowledge gaps or open questions:

(Populate continuously)




🔍 Testing & Validation

All tasks must successfully pass appropriate tests before marking the task as completed. Ensure validation clearly confirms task success.




🔄 Continuous Improvement Goals

Regularly:
[X] Assess documentation and process effectiveness
[ ] Identify repetitive tasks/inefficiencies for automation
[ ] Proactively challenge assumptions
[ ] Set periodic reviews (weekly/monthly)




Regularly revisit this document to summarize insights, prune unnecessary content, and preserve critical instructions clearly.
